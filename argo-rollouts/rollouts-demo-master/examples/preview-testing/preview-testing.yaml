# This rollout uses an experiment to start the new version as a preview stack, which receives no
# production traffic, but is still internally reachable inside the cluster. While the preview is
# running, the Experiment simultaneously starts an AnalysisRun which performs load testing via a
# k8s Job. This job runs the 'wrk' benchmarking tool and analyzes the latency and error rate of the
# preview stack. If the Experiment/Analysis is successful, the rollout proceeds, otherwise aborts.
